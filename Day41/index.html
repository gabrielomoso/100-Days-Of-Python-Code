    <h1>My Interests</h1>

    <h2>1. Forex Trading</h2>
    <p>
        Forex trading is not just a means to make income for me; it's a fascinating world of currencies, markets, and strategies. The dynamic nature of forex keeps me on my toes, and the potential for financial growth is both exciting and rewarding.

    <h2>2. Coding</h2>
    <p>
        As a computer science student, coding is not just a skill I'm acquiring; it's a journey of self-development. Writing code allows me to create, innovate, and problem-solve. The continuous learning process in the world of programming keeps me engaged and motivated.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Working Out</h2>
    <p>
        Working out is an essential part of my routine, contributing to both my physical and mental well-being. Building muscle and paying attention to my overall health is a commitment I make to myself. It's not just about the external appearance but also about feeling strong, energetic, and focused in all aspects of life.
