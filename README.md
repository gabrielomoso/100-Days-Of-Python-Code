## Technologies Used

Throughout this course, I've worked with various technologies and libraries:

- **Python Core**: Lists, dictionaries, functions, OOP
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Requests, Beautiful Soup, Selenium, Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs, API Authentication
- **Databases**: SQLite, SQL
- **GUI Development**: Tkinter
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login, password hashing
- **Deployment**: Local development

## Setup and Installation

To run any of these projects:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the specific day's folder
3. Install required packages (usually listed in requirements.txt):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the main Python file:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Note on API Keys and Sensitive Information

All API keys, passwords, and sensitive information have been removed from the code and stored in a separate `info.md` file which is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`. To run projects that require API keys or credentials, you'll need to:

1. Obtain your own API keys from the respective services
2. Create environment variables or add them directly to the code

## Learning Journey

This repository represents my learning journey through Python programming. While I haven't completed all 100 days yet, the projects demonstrate progression from basic Python concepts to more complex web applications and automation tools.
